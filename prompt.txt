 create a database application named "Super Dube" that will manage sets of information related to personnel and their skills and the demand for those skills in certain roles/jobs in the organization.  for example, we would want to list a new role or job function and for this job we would list the skills required.  also a list of staff who possess those skills.  for a skill there should also be an associated training program that staff can be enrolled in to progress their career.  also a skill may have a certification associated with it and an expiry date at which point the staff member would need to pass an exam to maintain proficiency.  This could apply to Naval Operations in the military, or Dental staff in an office.  generate sample data for the dentist use case.
